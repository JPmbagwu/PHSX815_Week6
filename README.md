# PHSX815_Week6

These programs are available in this repository:

* Trap_Gauss_Python.py [Python]. which compares the trapezoidal rule with the Gaussian Quadrature methods, or numerical integration to evaluate a function in a finite interval.
* MCIntegrate_Python.py [Python].

# Usage

The usage of these separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy (pyhon)
* scipy.integrate (python)
* sympy (python)

They python file 

* Trap_Gauss_Python.py
* MCIntegrate_Python.py

can be run from the Command/Terminal line by typing:

`<> python Trap_Gauss_Python.py `

`<> MCIntegrate_Python.py `

This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, seed, scipy.integrate and Matplotlib also installed.
